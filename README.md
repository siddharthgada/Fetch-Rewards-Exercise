# Fetch Rewards Data Modeling & Analysis
This repository contains my solutions for the Fetch Rewards Data Modeling & Analysis Challenge, which involved structuring unstructured JSON data, writing SQL queries, identifying data quality issues, and communicating insights to stakeholders.<br>

🚀 Project Overview<br>
This project required transforming raw, unstructured JSON data into a structured relational data model, writing business-focused SQL queries, and evaluating data quality issues. The key objectives included: <br>

✔️ Data Modeling: Designing a structured relational database schema based on provided sample data.<br>
✔️ SQL Queries: Answering business questions using optimized queries.<br>
✔️ Data Quality Assessment: Identifying potential inconsistencies, missing values, and anomalies.<br>
✔️ Stakeholder Communication: Writing a clear and concise business report.<br>

📂 Project Deliverables:<br>

1. Relational Data Model<br>
  - Reviewed unstructured JSON data and created a structured relational ER Diagram.<br>
  - Defined tables, fields, primary keys, and foreign keys for optimal data organization.<br>
  - ER Diagram Link: <a href=https://github.com/siddharthgada/Fetch-Rewards-Exercise/blob/main/images/ER_Diagram.png>...</a> <br>


2. Business-Focused SQL Queries:<br>
SQL queries were written to answer the following key business questions:<br>
  - Query 1: Top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the most recent month. <a href=https://github.com/siddharthgada/Fetch-Rewards-Exercise/blob/main/images/Query1Results.png>...</a><br>
  - Query 2: Average spend comparison for 'Accepted' vs. 'Rejected' receipts. <a href=https://github.com/siddharthgada/Fetch-Rewards-Exercise/blob/main/images/Query2Results.png>...</a><br>
  - Query 3: Total items purchased comparison for 'Accepted' vs. 'Rejected' receipts. <a href=https://github.com/siddharthgada/Fetch-Rewards-Exercise/blob/main/images/Query3Results.png>...</a><br>
  - Query 4: Brand with the highest spend among users created within the past 6 months. <a href=https://github.com/siddharthgada/Fetch-Rewards-Exercise/blob/main/images/Query4Results.png>...</a><br>
  - Query 5: Brand with the most transactions among users created within the past 6 months. <a href=https://github.com/siddharthgada/Fetch-Rewards-Exercise/blob/main/images/Query5Results.png>...</a><br>

3. Data Quality Assessment<br>
Using Python and SQL, I analyzed the dataset for potential data quality issues, including:<br>
  - Missing or inconsistent data in key fields.<br>
  - Duplicate records and anomalies.<br>
  - Inconsistent date formats and incorrect timestamps.<br>
  - Irregularities in rewardsReceiptStatus values.<br>

📊 Technologies & Tools Used:
1. SQL: Querying and analyzing structured data.
2. Python (Pandas, NumPy): Data exploration, anomaly detection, and validation.
3. Database Modeling: Designing relational schema for structured storage.
4. Diagramming Tools (Visio): ER diagram creation for data structure visualization.
5. Google BigQuery: Database creation and querying

🔍 Key Learning Outcomes:<br>
📌 Data Modeling & Normalization:<br>
  - Learned how to analyze raw JSON data and design a relational schema for a data warehouse.<br>
  - Understood the importance of primary and foreign keys in maintaining data integrity.<br>
📌 SQL Query Optimization:<br>
  - Gained experience in writing efficient SQL queries to extract business insights.<br>
  - Applied ranking functions, aggregation, and filtering to answer real-world business questions.<br>
📌 Data Quality Analysis:<br>
  - Discovered common data quality issues, such as duplicate entries, missing values, and format inconsistencies.<br>
  - Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL to identify and address anomalies in the dataset.<br>
📌 Effective Communication:<br>
  - Developed clear and concise business reports and email communication for non-technical stakeholders.<br>
  - Practised translating technical findings into actionable business recommendations.<br>
