# Fetch Rewards Data Modeling & Analysis
This repository contains my solutions for the Fetch Rewards Data Modeling & Analysis Challenge, which involved structuring unstructured JSON data, writing SQL queries, identifying data quality issues, and communicating insights to stakeholders.

🚀 Project Overview
This project required transforming raw, unstructured JSON data into a structured relational data model, writing business-focused SQL queries, and evaluating data quality issues. The key objectives included:

✔️ Data Modeling: Designing a structured relational database schema based on provided sample data.
✔️ SQL Queries: Answering business questions using optimized queries.
✔️ Data Quality Assessment: Identifying potential inconsistencies, missing values, and anomalies.
✔️ Stakeholder Communication: Writing a clear and concise business report.

📂 Project Deliverables

1. Relational Data Model
Reviewed unstructured JSON data and created a structured relational ER Diagram.
Defined tables, fields, primary keys, and foreign keys for optimal data organization.
Diagram Link: ER Diagram

2. Business-Focused SQL Queries
SQL queries were written to answer the following key business questions:
✅ Top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the most recent month.
✅ Average spend comparison for 'Accepted' vs. 'Rejected' receipts.
✅ Total items purchased comparison for 'Accepted' vs. 'Rejected' receipts.
✅ Brand with the highest spend among users created within the past 6 months.
✅ Brand with the most transactions among users created within the past 6 months.

3. Data Quality Assessment
Using Python and SQL, I analyzed the dataset for potential data quality issues, including:
🚨 Missing or inconsistent data in key fields.
🚨 Duplicate records and anomalies.
🚨 Inconsistent date formats and incorrect timestamps.
🚨 Irregularities in rewardsReceiptStatus values.

📊 Technologies & Tools Used
SQL: Querying and analyzing structured data.
Python (Pandas, NumPy): Data exploration, anomaly detection, and validation.
Database Modeling: Designing relational schema for structured storage.
Diagramming Tools (Visio): ER diagram creation for data structure visualization.
Google BigQuery: Database creation and querying

🔍 Key Learning Outcomes
